# FinalGPA
A GPA Calculator that calculates your overall, technical, and CS GPA at once. You simply add your semesters, courses for each semester, and whether these course are technical and/or CS, and all the work is done for you. Perfect for figuring out your highest GPA to put on a resume and keeping your stats from one semester to the next (the information is stored on your browser) so you do not have to recalculate every time.
